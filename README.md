# TeachablePy
A Python Chatbot that can be taught how to respond.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python 3
2. Clone this repo into your directory and your done!

## Usage
Run the .py file in your favortite IDE or terminal!

## How It Works
This simple chatbot works differently then the traditional models. 
Instead of tons of if/else statements that check for patterns between input and output. 
This program creates a csv file, which are used for storing data in spreadsheet applications, 
and stores the questions and responses that the computer can use to chat with the user. 
Whats the difference?
This allows for users to make complex or personalized chatbots and be able to share their custom chatbot by sharing their,
`knowledge.csv` file giving other users the exact same bot! 
Essentially, its a one program fits all scenario, you can have a complex or simple bot with one program.

## Improvements
By no means is this project finished, there are some things I would like to see done with this project:
- A base knowledge.csv file that has basic responses to common phrases.

If you have any custom bots please share them!
