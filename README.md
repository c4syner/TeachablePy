# TeachablePy
A Python Chatbot that can be taught how to respond.

## Installation
1. Make sure you have the latest version of Python 3
2. Clone this repo into your directory and your done!

## Usage
Run the .py file in your favortite IDE or terminal!

## How It Works
This simple chatbot works differently then the traditional models. <br />
Instead of tons of if/else statements that check for patterns between input and output. <br />
This program creates a csv file and stores the questions and responses that the computer can use to chat with the user. <br />
Whats the difference? <br />
This allows for users to make complex or personalized chatbots and be able to share their custom chatbot by sharing their, <br />
`knowledge.csv` file giving other users the exact same bot! <br />
Essentially, its a one program fits all scenario, you can have a complex or simple bot with one program. <br />

## Improvements
By no means is this project finished, there are some things I would like to see done with this project:
- A base knowledge.csv file that has basic responses to common phrases.

If you have any custom bots please share them!
